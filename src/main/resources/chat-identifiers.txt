last stand does not display any chat message if you hit no one, if you do, it says:
Your Last Stand is now protecting <player>!
for consistency i guess we could do a premature status that stacks. don't want extra logic to only register 1

undying army self always displays:
Your Undying Army is protecting you and 0 nearby allies.
